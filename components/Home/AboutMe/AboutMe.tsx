                  Hello! My name is Abdellatif and I enjoy solving problems and
                  creating codes that live on the internet. My interest in
                  computer science started back in 2009 when I decided to try
                  learning{" "}
                  <span className="text-AAsecondary">Ethical Hacking</span>{" "}
                  using BackTrack OS â€” turns out programming skills are
                  essential to achieve that, my journey with programming started
                  from that time!

              <div className="font-Header tracking-wide">
                <span className="text-gray-400  ">
                  Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the privilege of
                  working at
                  <br />a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design
                  studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
                  inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for
                  a variety of clients. that time!
